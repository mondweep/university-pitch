- **API latency issues** → Mock data fallback, load testing
- **Data quality problems** → Validate beforehand, use high-quality subset
- **Integration bugs** → Extensive testing, staged rollout

### Business Risks
- **Stakeholder skepticism** → Use real LBS data, third-party validation
- **Complexity overwhelming** → Progressive disclosure, layered explanations
- **Budget concerns** → Show incremental approach, clear ROI
- **Timeline pressure** → Start with Demo #1, expand later
